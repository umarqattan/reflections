When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I'd use a remote repository when I find it necessary to make a save point (checkpoint)
  of my progress.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  There might be a reason to pull manually as opposed to Git automatically keeping the
  user up-to-date. Any pull request will be diagrammed in a logical fashion, so the
  workflow is neat and meaningful. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Fork  : Cloning another's repository on GitHub
  Clone : Cloning a repository (Either on github or elsewhere) to a local machine
  Branch: A commit whose parents are previous commits.
